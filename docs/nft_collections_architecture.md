# Soroban NFT Standard Technical Architecture Document

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the technical architecture for the new Soroban NFT Standard, aiming to standardize NFT creation, management, and trade on the Soroban platform. It builds upon the ERC-721 protocol to introduce interoperability, security, and enhanced features for a comprehensive NFT ecosystem.

## 2. Objectives

- Standardize NFT interfaces and collections on Soroban.
- Ensure interoperability and compatibility across different platforms.
- Introduce enhanced features for improved NFT management and usability.

## 3. Technical Overview

The Soroban NFT Standard is divided into two main components:

1. **Rust Crate for NFT Interface and Collections**
2. **Smart Contracts for NFT Base Token and Collections**

### 3.1 Rust Crate for NFT Interface and Collections

The Rust crate provides the foundational structures and functionalities required for NFT management.

#### 3.1.1 NFT Interface

Defines the standard interface for NFTs, ensuring consistency and interoperability.

```rust
pub trait Nft {
    fn initialize(
        /// Name of the NFT contract
        name: String,
        /// Symbol of the NFT contract
        symbol: String,

        minter: Option<String>,
        withdraw_address: Option<String>,
    )

    fn mint(
        /// Unique ID of the NFT
        token_id: String,
        /// The owner of the newly minter NFT
        owner: String,
        /// Universal resource identifier for this NFT
        /// Should point to a JSON file that conforms to the ERC721
        /// Metadata JSON Schema
        token_uri: Option<String>,
        /// Any custom extension used by this contract
        extension: T,
    )
}

pub struct Metadata {
    pub image: Option<String>,
    pub image_data: Option<String>,
    pub external_url: Option<String>,
    pub description: Option<String>,
    pub name: Option<String>,
    pub attributes: Option<Vec<Trait>>,
    pub background_color: Option<String>,
    pub animation_url: Option<String>,
    pub youtube_url: Option<String>,
}

pub type Extension = Option<Metadata>;
```

### 3.2 Smart Contracts for NFT Base Token and Collections

Smart contracts implement the NFT standard, providing mechanisms for creating, transferring, and managing NFTs on the blockchain.

#### 3.2.1 NFT Base Token Contract

Defines the base structure for NFTs, including metadata storage and transfer logic.

```rust
// Note: Pseudocode for illustrating contract structure
contract NFTBaseToken {
    struct NFT {
        owner: AccountId,
        metadata: String,
    }

    fn create_nft(&self, owner: AccountId, metadata: String) -> u64 {
        // Implementation for creating an NFT
    }

    fn transfer_nft(&self, to: AccountId, token_id: u64) {
        // Implementation for transferring an NFT
    }

    // Additional NFT functionalities
}
```

#### 3.2.2 Enhanced Features
Withdrawal Address Management

```rust
fn set_withdrawal_address(&mut self, address: AccountId) {
    // Logic for setting a withdrawal address
}
```

Allowances and Operators

```rust
fn set_allowance(&mut self, operator: AccountId, allowed: bool) {
    // Logic for setting allowances for operators
}
```

Comprehensive Metadata Storage

Embeds all metadata directly within the blockchain, excluding images which are stored as URLs.

```rust
fn set_metadata(&mut self, token_id: u64, metadata: String) {
    // Logic for setting NFT metadata
}
```

## 4. Security Considerations

Security is paramount in the design and implementation of the Soroban NFT Standard. Smart contracts will undergo rigorous testing and external audits to ensure they are secure against common vulnerabilities.

## 5. Conclusion

The Soroban NFT Standard aims to provide a robust framework for NFT interoperability and management on the Soroban platform. By leveraging Rust for the development of interfaces and collections, and smart contracts for on-chain functionalities, this standard seeks to enhance the NFT ecosystem's usability and security.
